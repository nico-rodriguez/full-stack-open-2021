# Bloglist backend

## Running

Run the server in production mode: `npm start`; or in development mode: `npm run dev`.

The development server includes the automatic reload on save (thanks to `nodemon`).

It listens on the port given by the `PORT` environment variable (see `.env` file).

The server expects a MongoDB listening on `TEST_MONGODB_URI` (see `.env` file).
